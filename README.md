# Live-class-Vue practice with Ikenna

This is a simple todo app and the goal is to get it completely functional.

Below are a list of functionalities I believe would the app.

- delete a todo
  Self explanatory, in this scenario once the delete button is clicked, the todo should be removed from the list

- complete a todo
  in this case, when the completed button is clicked, the todo should be have a line through on it's text this scenario is already the default state of the dummy todo item. The goal is to make the linethrough only visible when a todo has been completed.

:hint
conditional styling -> https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/class-and-style.html

:bonus
after the todo has been completed there should be an option to undo the completed todo, use your creativity to come up with a solution to undo the completed todo

Also an edge case i'll like handled is after a todo has been added, the input field should be cleared in anticipation of another todo being added.
